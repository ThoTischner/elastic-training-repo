# ** EXAM OBJECTIVE: INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION **
# GOAL: Deploy an Elasticsearch cluster that satisfies a given set of requirements
# REQUIRED SETUP: /

# Download the the exam version of Elasticsearch
# Deploy the cluster `eoc-01-cluster`, so that it satisfies the following requirements: (i) has three nodes, named `elastic-node-1`, `elastic-node-2`, and `elastic-node-3`, (ii) all nodes are eligible master nodes
# Bind `elastic-node-1` to the IP address “192.168.5.11” and port “9201”
# Bind `elastic-node-2` to the IP address “192.168.5.12” and port “9202”
# Bind `elastic-node-3` to the IP address “192.168.5.13” and port “9203”
# Configure network to use lo and eth1
# Configure the nodes to avoid the split brain scenario
# Configure `elastic-node-1` to be a data node but not an ingest node
# Configure `elastic-node-2` and `elastic-node-3` to be both an ingest and data node
# Configure `elastic-node-1` to disallow swapping on its host
# Configure the JVM settings of each node so that it uses a minimum and maximum of 1 GB for the heap
# Configure the logging settings of each node so that (i) the logs directory is not the default one, (ii) the log level for transport-related events is set to "debug"
# Configure the nodes so as to disable the possibility to delete indices using wildcards
